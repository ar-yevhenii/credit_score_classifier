# Credit Score Classifier

This project is a machine learning classifier that predicts credit scores based on various financial and personal factors. The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`classification.ipynb`).

## Project Structure

- `classification.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various financial and personal information required to predict credit scores. Ensure that the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Model

The classifier is built using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.). The notebook includes detailed steps for feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed in the notebook.
